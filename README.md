# Wordle
Wordle a game, where you guess a word from a secret list
The game is played from the startmenu, where you can click play, where the game will start selecting a secret word from a list. On the board the fields containing letters light up either grey, yellow or green depending on the word being in the secret word and the position of it. Your score is saved in a SQLite database file locally stored, settings have been set for music volume. Unit testing have testet the logic for the player records, WordGame and GameManager functions sucessfully, since there was problems with assembly references breaking the game, if added instead of namespaces, which was not accepted for that folder.
